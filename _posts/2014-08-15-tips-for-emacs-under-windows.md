## Default folder in emacs when C-x C-f
### default folder location is not what I want
After I start windows emacs, I usually try to find some file by C-x C-f, ido-find-file. However, the default folder from the command seems to be my emacs bin folder even though I set up my HOME envrionment in windows. It was because I run the emacs from the windows shortcut.

### change default folder in windows emacs
right click the emacs shortcut > select properties > change the start in field.

[Here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/60464/changing-the-default-folder-in-emacs) are two other solutions and explanation for this issue.
