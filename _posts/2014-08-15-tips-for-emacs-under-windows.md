## Default folder in emacs when C-x C-f
The default folder from the command seems to be my emacs bin folder even though I set up my HOME envrionment in windows. It was because I run the emacs from the windows shortcut. I can easily fix by **right click the windows emacs shortcut > select properties > change the start in field.**

[Here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/60464/changing-the-default-folder-in-emacs) are two other solutions and explanation for this issue.
