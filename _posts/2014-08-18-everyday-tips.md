## Google analytics says "Tracking Not Installed"
I copy and pasted the tracking code to jekyll _includes/head.html. However, I wasn't sure about whether it's really installed or not. I followed the google's instruction but what I see was "Tracking Not Installed". **It will be showing correct status after a while** according to the [stackoverflow answer](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16952379/google-analytics-says-tracking-not-installed-but-i-see-it-working). Quick way to check is [visiting the Real-Time section](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1638635?hl=en) in the analytics menu.
